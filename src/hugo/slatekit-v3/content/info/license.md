# Dual License
Slate Kit has a unique Dual License approach using BSL (Business Source License) and Apache 2.0 using the Additional Use Grants parameter of the BSL. This is a reletively new license and approach. At the moment, we are making this framework as permissive as possible and more details will come. We plan to allow this to be used as Apache 2.0 immediately for the groups listed below.

# Apache 2.0
This is effectively Apache 2.0 for the following groups and usage

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
    <tr><td><strong>Non-Profits</strong></td><td> Non-Profit institutions ( .org ) </td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Educational</strong></td><td>Educational institutions ( .edu ) </td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Startups</strong></td><td>Same as Commercial ( see below ) </td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Personal</strong></td><td>Personal projects for non-commercial use</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Commerical</strong></td><td>Must <strong>NOT</strong> be a Cloud Provider company and/or used for building Cloud-Provider infrastructure ( such as AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Digital Ocean, etc )</td></tr>
</table>

# BSL 1.1 
For Cloud-Providers such as AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Digital Ocean, etc, this is a BSL license. 
It can not be used for production usage without obtaining a license.

# Notes
- BSL is a relatively new license type.
- BSL is technicall NOT an open-source" license but rather source available
- BSL has parameters Change Date | Change License | Additional Use that convert it to open source
- BSL Additional Use Grant is used to grant production use and further rights to various groups
