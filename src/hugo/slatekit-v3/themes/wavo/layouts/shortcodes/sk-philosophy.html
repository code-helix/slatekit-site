    <tr>
      <td><strong>Design</strong></td>
      <td>Library based approach instead of a "Framework". Structured into several modules so you can pick as little or as much as you want.

      <td><strong>Minimal</strong></td>
      <td>Dependencies on external, 3rd-party libraries are kept to a minimum. Json Simple, OkHttp( for Http client ), Logback( Optional ), Micrometer ( Optional )</td>

    <tr>
      <td><strong>Style</strong></td>
      <td>Emphasis on <strong>immutability</strong> 
        and <strong>pragmatic functional programming</strong> as much as possible.
        <br>However, this is <strong>NOT</strong> a 100% purely functional code base, and there is <strong>NO</strong> category theory.
